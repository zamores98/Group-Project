                We are an anime streaming and merchandising business. We were founded at Virginia Commonwealth university. Our brand is headed by Phuc Nguyen and Zach Amores.<br> We have always had dreams of building and managing an anime website/business, we finally decided to make our brand in 2018. Our favorite anime is One Piece.<br> Our goal is to satisfy anime fans all around the world and to share their love for anime on our website with monthly promotions.
